For my project 0 page, I tried to tell a story about myself coming in as a Seattle musician to a Bay Area web developer. Starting off with the the Seattle landscape and ending with a landscape of the Bay Area as the footer to show my transition.

For this project, I used quite a bit of flexbox, by quite a bit I mean a lot. There's a couple of carousels (by slick) that I threw in as well, underneath my about photo and in my projects section. I comtemplated on using music for the projects gallery that plays a note as you hover over it. I even started to write out an algorithm for it, but I realized that might not be the best for the user.

There's some font awesome icons, credit to the people of font awesome for giving developers a more flashy page.

I struggled with AJAX so I wanted to incorporate that into this project. I threw in a NASA API that came out better than I expected. I read a lot on the subject so it could be perfect, but it wasn't until I trusted myself that I got it done and felt confident about it.
